# Intro
This is a simple Android application, showing a WebView with a basic html form. 
The html form includes autocomplete hints, for filling user data with existing 
user information. 


# Preparation
- setup an autofill service
  - Google Pixel 6a, Android 13: _Passwords & accounts_ > _Autofill service_
- in my case I use the _Google_ Autofill service
- make sure, the _Autofill service_ is enabled and provides data (check the settings)


# Testing
- start the app
- begin typing in the fields, the autofill services should immediately provide data
